# Cursor Rules for Hummingbot

## Project Context
Hummingbot is a modular cryptocurrency trading bot framework with advanced strategy architecture.

**Technology Stack**:
- Python 3.10+
- Modular strategy architecture (strategy_v2_base.py)
- WebSocket for real-time data
- Exchange connectors abstraction
- Real-time PnL tracking

## Project Goal
Study and integrate Hummingbot's modular strategy architecture and exchange connectors into Freqtrade system.

## Code Style & Best Practices

### Python Conventions
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use `snake_case` for variables, functions, and modules
- Use `PascalCase` for classes
- Type hints are encouraged

### Hummingbot-Specific Rules
- Study `strategy_v2_base.py` for modular architecture
- Use exchange connector abstraction
- Implement entry/exit filters system
- Support strategy auto-switching (long ↔ short)
- Real-time WebSocket price feeds

### Key Components to Study
1. **Strategy Architecture**: `hummingbot/strategy/strategy_v2_base.py`
   - Lifecycle hooks
   - Entry/exit filters
   - Position sizing
   - Risk management

2. **Exchange Connectors**: `hummingbot/connector/`
   - Unified connector interface
   - Multiple exchange support
   - WebSocket price feeds
   - Order management

3. **Strategy Filters**: Entry/exit conditions
   - Technical indicators
   - Market conditions
   - Position adjustment (DCA)
   - Risk management rules

### Integration with Freqtrade
- Extract modular concepts
- Adapt to Freqtrade's IStrategy interface
- Implement base strategy class with filters
- Add auto-switching support

## Key Principles
1. **Modularity** - Reusable components
2. **Abstraction** - Exchange-agnostic logic
3. **Flexibility** - Easy strategy switching
4. **Real-time** - WebSocket for live data
